### so_long · https://github.com/aboodjabr0/so_long
A 2D Pac‑Man–style game built in C using MiniLibX (42 School project). Collect all items and reach the exit while avoiding ghosts.

Badges: [![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) [![42 Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/42-Project-000000.svg)](https://42.fr/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/aboodjabr0/so_long/blob/main/LICENSE)

One-line: A compact C game that practices file parsing, map validation, and 2D movement using MiniLibX.

Why it matters:
- Great demonstration of C fundamentals, memory and resource management, and simple game logic.
- Shows ability to work with external libraries (MiniLibX) and cross-platform considerations (Linux/macOS).

Tech: C, MiniLibX, Makefile

Quick Start (from the repo)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aboodjabr0/so_long.git
cd so_long
make
./so_long maps/map1.ber
```

Requirements (summary)
- OS: Linux or macOS
- Compiler: gcc or clang
- Build tool: make
- X11 / graphics libraries (Linux) or XQuartz (macOS)
- The repo includes a bundled MiniLibX in `mlx/` so a separate install isn’t required.

Controls
- W / ↑ : Move up
- A / ← : Move left
- S / ↓ : Move down
- D / → : Move right
- ESC : Quit

Highlights & Features
- Retro-style 2D graphics and smooth controls
- Enemy AI with different ghost behaviors
- Move counter and scoring system
- Custom `.ber` map support for level design
- Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS Monterey

Notes
- The `mlx/` directory includes MiniLibX so the project is easier to build.
- If the window doesn't open on Linux, ensure X11 and libxext/libbsd are installed.

If you'd like me to make the project entry even richer, I can incorporate screenshots, a short GIF demo, and a couple of highlighted code snippets from the repo to showcase technical highlights (map parsing, enemy logic, or Makefile details).
